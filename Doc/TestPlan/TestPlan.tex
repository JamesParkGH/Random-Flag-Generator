This document describes the plan for software testing of Random Flag Generator.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this test plan is to describe the testing and validation process of The Random Flag Generator in detail. This test plan will properly access the functional and non-functional requirements of the software as well as performance and usability. The test cases will address each individual unit of source code and can be referred or updated with future implementations. The test plan aims to minimize the probability of error when used by the user. 

\subsection{Scope}
The test plan considers and tests all functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements through 
different testing procedures. Test for proof of concept is also demonstrated. In addition, comparison 
to existing implementation is discussed to compare its functionality and improve the design. Unit 
testing plan for internal functions and output files is outlined. Finally, the usability survey 
questions will evaluate user experience. The test plan will be conducted accordingly, and the document 
will be revised with more development of the project.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
The test plan how the team is going to test the software and the automated testing tools. All requirements included in the SRS will be tested. Tests for proof of concept as well as comparison to existing implementation, unit testing, and usability survey questions are described.

\section{Plan}
    
\subsection{Software Description}
The Random Flag Generator is a user-friendly software that allows users to uniquely create a personalized random flag based on the entered input string. It is built using python and is inspired from PAGAN, an open source that generates an avatar from an input string. 

\subsection{Test Team}
All members of group 2 are responsible for creating, executing, and documenting tests. The testing team is comprised of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Akram Hannoufa
    \item Ganghoon Park
    \item Nathaniel Hu
  \end{itemize}  
Upon completing the final stage of development, TAs, students, and other volunteers would be asked to provide feedback using the usability survey questions.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
To review and validate the software product, automated testing for each output testing. It will be performed automatically by running the test program. The hash functions along with the flag generator functions will be tested automatically to ensure that the input string gives the expected output string and that it is repeatable.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
The main software testing framework that will be used is pytest, which will allow testers to write test cases in python and report the results. It is a simple, efficient, and effective way to handle increasingly complex testing requirements. 

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
Please refer to project Gantt chart: ../ProjectSchedule/3XA3Ganttchart.pdf

How test will be performed: A new hashing algorithm/function will be added to
the FlagGenerator program, and then the GUI will be initialized. The user will
attempt to generate a new flag using the new hashing algorithm and an input
string, and the generated flag should be different from all of the other flags
generated using that input string and all other existing hashing algorithms.

\item{PE-11\\}

Type: Manual, Nonfunctional, Dynamic

Initial State: GUI is uninitialized

Input/Condition: new flag components are added (i.e. new .jka flag asset
files), command to initialize and run the GUI

Output/Result: program should be able to generate new flags using the new flag
asset files with only minor to no changes being made to the existing code.

How test will be performed: A new (or several) flag asset(s) will be added to
the FlagGenerator program, and then the GUI will be initialized. The user will
attempt to generate a new flag using the new flag asset(s) with specific input
strings (determining by trial and error), and the generated flag should use
the new flag asset(s).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Operational and Environmental Testing}

\paragraph{Expected Physical Environment Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PE-13\\}

Type: Manual, Nonfunctional, Dynamic

Initial State: GUI is uninitialized

Input/Condition: local machine has Wi-Fi disabled, command to initialize and
run the GUI

Output/Result: GUI is initialized and running

How test will be performed: The FlagGenerator program will be initialized and
run from the command line on a local machine with the Wi-Fi disabled. This
program should still function as it would even with the Wi-Fi enabled.

\item{PE-14\\}

Type: Manual, Nonfunctional, Dynamic

Initial State: GUI is uninitialized

Input/Condition: local machine can support (running) the Python language,
command to initialize and run the GUI

Output/Result: GUI is initialized and running

How test will be performed: The FlagGenerator program will be initialized and
run from the command line on several different local machines that can support
(running) the Python language. This program should still function the same on
all the different local machines.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Interfacing with Adjacent Systems Testing}

\paragraph{Interfacing with Adjacent Systems Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PE-15\\}

Type: Manual, Nonfunctional, Dynamic

Initial State: GUI is uninitialized

Input/Condition: command to initialize and run the GUI, user generates some
flag(s)

Output/Result: GUI is initialized and running, new flag(s) generated and saved
to the user's local machine

How test will be performed: The FlagGenerator program will be initialized and
run from the command line, and the user will attempt to generate some flag(s).
The user will then check that the program has only created/altered files
within its working directory (i.e. generated\_flags directory), and no where
else on the local machine.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

In terms of traceability, most test cases and requirements have a one to one
relationship, with exceptions and special cases noted. Some functional
requirements are covered using the same tests, because they are essentially
the same requirements, but are a part of different business events. See the
following traceability matrices for more details.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
        The flag generation program currently implements the majority of the core functionality, found in the original PAGAN program. 
        Mainly, Flag Generator currently implements hash generation using hashlib, mapping the hash to various flag design decisions (array indices),
        and generating the flag image. In addition, a minimal GUI has been implmeneted to handle user input and displaying flag output.
        The next steps are  expanding test cases and test coverage, implementing more flag design options (including more resolution choices), and enhancing the GUI, which includes the addition of a flag gallery.
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
        The pytest library will be used to carry out all unit testing for internal functions used in Flag Generator.
        5 python files will be made that will contain the pytest testing functions for the modules contained within each of the 5 main components of the project.
        FlagGenerator, GUI, HashGenerator, HashToFlag, and JKAReader will each have a corresponding Test python file.
        Within each main component, most but not all internal functions are able to be unit tested. The others will require some manual testing. 
        This is especially evident in the testing of the GUI, which will need to be done by the user to check functionality and usability requirements.
        For the modules that are able to be unit tested (modules mentioned in 3.1.2), assert statements will be setup to check that the modules are returning the correct values (based on externally calculated values), and that they are behaving as expected.
        The ``expected'' cases, boundary/limit cases, and any excpetions and error handling will be tested through pytest unit tests. 
        Using the testing coverage matrices, any unit testable funcional requirements will be covered in the unit tests. 
		Use of external libraries (PIL, tkinter) will have less thorough testing, since they are commercially available software products, and assumed to have some level of correctness and already done testing.
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}
        Some aspects of the outputted flag image will be able to be validated through unit testing, but others will be a visual/manual check.
        Flag generated images will have their width and height checked to ensure the user's resolution selection matches the output image resolution.
        Checking known hashing function outputs to make sure the corresponding flag design (colours, symbols, stripes, etc.) are all correct, will be done to verify some correctness in the generated symbols, although it will be unreasonable to 
        find hashes for every single combination of possible output designs.
        Unit tests can also be done to check the naming of files, file storage, and gallery display correctness.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}
Given that the Flag Generator program heavily relies on user input and their interactions with the GUI, as well as their opinion on the outputs of the program,
survey questions to gauge user experience will be used.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item On a scale of 1-10, how easy was it for your to navigate the program using the GUI?
    \item On a scale of 1-10, how appealing/aesthetically pleasing would you consider the flag images being generated?
    \item On a scale of 1-10, how straightforward was it to follow the intended flow of operations? (ie. entering input --> accessing generated flag image)
    \item On a scale of 1-10, how helpful was the ``Help'' button feature?
    \item Would you like more (or less) ability to set certain parts of the flag?
    \item Do you like having the flag gallery view? Is it worthwhile in your opinion?
    \item What other designs would you like to see available for the flags being generated?
    \item What parts of the GUI were not clear or straightforward to use?
\end{enumerate}
