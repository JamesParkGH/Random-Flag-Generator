\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly software that allows users to uniquely create a personalized random flag based on the entered input string. To enhance the interface, an extensive graphical user interface will be created. A uniquely generated flag can serve as a great inspiration to graphic designers, artists, or other media consumers and creators.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

The clients of this project are the professor of SFWRENG 3XA3, Dr. Asghar A. Bokhari, and the teaching assistants (TAs) of this course. They will help guide the project by providing instructions, expectations, assistance, and feedback. They will also evaluate the project based on its functionality, organization, requirement, and documentation.

\subsubsection{The Customers}

The customers of this project will be media consumers and creators. \textcolor{red}{These include users of social media websites and forums, players of nation building games, and any individuals who want or need to create a unique random flag.}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

Members of Group 2 are our other stakeholders of this project as they will be working to successfully design, implement, test, document, and launch this project. In addition, the developers of PAGAN (Python Avatar Generator for Absolute Nerds) and other random generating software may also be stakeholders if they wish to implement our ideas, changes, and improvements.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time constraint: the entire project must be completed by \textcolor{red}{April 12, 2022}.
    \item Application: the user must be able to operate the application.
    \item Cost: the cost shall be free to users.
  \end{enumerate}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

None have been documented so far, and there are no open issues on PAGAN's repository at the time of this SRS. 

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

There are similar products available, such as Scrontch's Flag Designer https://flag-designer.appspot.com/ and other flag generators; however, they do not take in an input string and they do not give users the option to personalize their flag. There are also existing products that use strings and hashing algorithms to generate random images, but not flags.

\subsection{New Problems}

Some problems that may exist after this software is launched include \textcolor{red}{lower} flag image quality, issues of copyright, and inappropriate use of flags. Users will be able to have high resolution images, but they may have a lower resolution flag than expected.

\subsection{Tasks}

Project tasks are scheduled and assigned. Please refer to project Gantt chart: ../ProjectSchedule/3XA3Ganttchart.pdf

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

Since the software is simple and discrete, there is no need for migration to the new product. The gallery within the application will allow data to be stored.

\subsection{Risks}

This project has minimal risk because it is intended to be user-friendly and simple. There is, however, a risk of poor performance and unexpected application crashes. This is be minimized with intensive testing. There are also risks of low team productivity; however, this will be managed through our communication and problem solving skills.

\subsection{Costs}

There is no monetary cost for this project, as it will be developed as an open source software. The cost of time and effort are to be considered. This project is within the scope of the SFWRENG 3XA3 course. Therefore, the resource cost will be reasonable.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsubsection{Documentation}

Software instructions will be included in a display window that is easily accessible from the main menu, for users to understand how to use the product along with its features.

\subsubsection{Training}

No training is required to use this application. 

\subsection{Waiting Room}

Some features that may be added in later releases include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Better resolutions and a \textcolor{red}{better} GUI
    \item Different language settings
    \item Sharing options through social media
    \item \textcolor{red}{Able to save images in different formats}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Online version}
    \item \textcolor{red}{More settings options}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance. \\ \\
